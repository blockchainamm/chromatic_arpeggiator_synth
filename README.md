# Chromatic arpeggiator synthesizer

The python script can emulate a Chromatic arpeggiator synthesizer

For each note is the input sequence the chromatic arpeggiator is played for an interval of 1-1-1-1 half step in ascending order of frequency.

To emulate the chromatic arpeggiator effect each sequence of notes is played repeatedly five consecutive times.

Below is the frequencies played for an input sequence of 'C4', 'G4', 'A4', 'F4'
